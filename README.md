From the analysis, it can be concluded that the year 1994 witnessed the highest rate of conflicts, 
primarily driven by instances of one-sided violence. This period is marked by significant turmoil, 
reflecting the intensity and scale of violence that characterized the conflicts during that year. 
Additionally, the African region emerged as the most conflict-ridden, recording the highest number of incidents, 
a trend likely influenced by various socio-political and ethnic tensions prevalent across the continent. 
The Middle East follows closely, highlighting the region's long-standing history of strife and instability. 
In contrast, the Americas experienced the lowest rate of conflict, suggesting a relatively more stable environment 
during the period under review.
